    # A LLM application developed during the LLM March *MADNESS* Hackathon
    - Developed by: Mayk Caldas ([@maykcaldas](https://github.com/maykcaldas)) and Sam Cox ([@SamCox822](https://github.com/SamCox822))

    ## What is this?
    - This is a demo of a LLM agent that can answer questions about materials science using the [LangChainü¶úÔ∏èüîó](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) and the [Materials Project API](https://materialsproject.org/).
    - Its behave is based on Large Language Models (LLM) and aim to be a tool to help scientists with quick predictions of a nunerous of properties of materials.
    It is a work in progress, so please be patient with it.


    ### Some keys are needed in order to use it:
    1. An openAI API key ( [Check it here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) )
    2. A material project's API key ( [Check it here](https://materialsproject.org/api#api-key) )
