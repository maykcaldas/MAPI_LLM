# MAPI_LLM 🧱🦜️🔗

## A LLM application developed during the LLM March *MADNESS* Hackathon
  - Developed by: 
    - Mayk Caldas ([@maykcaldas](https://github.com/maykcaldas)), and 
    - Sam Cox ([@SamCox822](https://github.com/SamCox822))

### What is this?
- This is a demo of an app that can answer questions about material science using the [LangChain🦜️🔗](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/) and the [Materials Project API](https://materialsproject.org/).
- Its behavior is based on Large Language Models (LLM), and it aims to be a tool to help scientists with quick predictions of numerous properties of materials.

A brief video presentation on how to use this app can be found [here](https://twitter.com/SamCox822/status/1641484192566460416) and [here](https://twitter.com/Kyam888/status/1641485895189639192).

>It is a work in progress, so please be patient with it. 
>We are working on a systematic validation.
